# End of the field challange

This is an exercise where we had to build 2 interfaces to see how far we've gotton during our first month of coding at BeCode.

## The exercise

This exercise consists of 2 parts. A simple interface and a more complex one. We could choose to make a simple and complex one or two simple ones.
It was a solo exercise so no help was provided.

## Tools

- Duckduckgo search engine
- fonts.google
- gimp
- colorpicker

## What I made of it

[Interface 11 - simple](https://willemdt369.github.io/end-of-field-challenge/index)

[Interface 1 - complex](https://willemdt369.github.io/end-of-field-challenge/index2)
